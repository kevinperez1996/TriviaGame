# TriviaGame
In the Automotive Trivia Game, you begin by clicking the start button. At that point the timer will begin, and you will have 60 seconds to answer 10 questions related to some car brands. Once the timer runs out, the game will add up all of the correct answers that you seleceted and display your score at the end, and an image based on your score. If you answer all of the questions before the timmer runs out, you can also use the submit button to see your results. This Project was a bit tougher than I anticipated. Implementing the HTML and design was not bad and was about what I expected but adding the JS and Jquery was a bit more tricky that I expected, and I had to think a bit differently to get the game to properly work.
